## 🔄 Daily Limit Logic

The daily limit system works as follows:

1. **Shared Limit Across All AP Courses:**
   - User gets **1 grading per day total**
   - Applies to: SAQ, DBQ, LEQ, Essay, AP Gov, AP Psych, AP Micro, AP Macro, AP Human Geo, **AP Statistics**
   - Once you grade ANY FRQ, you cannot grade another until tomorrow

2. **Usage Tracking:**
   - Stored in `daily_usage.json` on Heroku
   - Tracks: user email, date, count, last endpoint type
   - Resets automatically at midnight UTC

3. **Error Messages:**
   - Shows which type was already used
   - Clear "Try again tomorrow" message
   - Consistent across all endpoints

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Why 15-80 Words (vs 10-60 for other courses)?
AP Statistics FRQs typically require:
- Clear explanation of statistical concepts
- Justification with data/context from scenarios
- Reference to specific statistical methods (z-tests, boxplots, etc.)
- More detailed reasoning than simple concept application

This is slightly longer than AP Gov (10-60) but still concise enough for cost-effective grading.

### Why gpt-3.5-turbo-0125?
- Proven effective for similar short-answer AP courses
- Cost-effective for educational use
- Sufficient for grading statistical concepts and calculations
- Fast response times
- Good at understanding statistical terminology

### LocalStorage Keys
- Each FRQ page has unique key: `apstat-frq-answers-{componentname}`
- Examples:
  - `apstat-frq-answers-apstatisticsshortfrq1`
  - `apstat-frq-answers-apstatisticsshortfrq2`
- Prevents answer conflicts between pages
- Auto-clears after successful grading
