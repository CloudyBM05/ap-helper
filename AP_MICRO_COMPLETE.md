## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Endpoint responds to POST requests
- [ ] Authentication is required (401 without token)
- [ ] Daily limit enforced (429 after 1 use)
- [ ] Returns structured JSON results
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully

### Frontend Testing (Per Page)

#### Long FRQ Set 1
- [ ] Open page, see PDF
- [ ] Not logged in → yellow banner shows
- [ ] Click "log in" → AuthModal opens
- [ ] Log in → banner disappears, submit enabled
- [ ] Type answers → localStorage saves
- [ ] Refresh page → answers persist
- [ ] Check word counts (15-120 valid range)
- [ ] Submit → grading works
- [ ] Try again same day → daily limit message

#### Long FRQ Set 2
- [ ] Same tests as Set 1

#### Short FRQ Set1Q1, Set1Q2, Set1Q3
- [ ] Same auth/localStorage/validation tests
- [ ] Word counts: 10-80 valid range

## 🔥 UNIFIED DAILY LIMIT

**How it works:**
1. Student grades ANY FRQ in ANY course (APUSH, World, Gov, Psych, Micro)
2. Backend increments their daily count to 1
3. If they try to grade another FRQ same day → 429 error
4. Frontend shows: "Daily limit reached. You already used your 1 free AI grading today (micro-frq). Try again tomorrow!"
5. Next day (UTC timezone) → count resets to 0

**Tracked endpoint types:**
- `saq` - APUSH/World SAQ
- `dbq` - APUSH/World DBQ
- `leq` - APUSH/World LEQ
- `essay` - General essay
- `apgov` - AP Gov FRQs
- `psych-frq` - AP Psych FRQs
- `micro-frq` - AP Micro FRQs ✨

---

## ✨ WHAT'S NEW

Students can now:
- ✅ Practice Long FRQs (Set 1 & 2) with AI grading
- ✅ Practice Short FRQs (Set1Q1, Q2, Q3 + Set2Q2, Q3) with AI grading
- ✅ Get instant, detailed feedback with scores and explanations
- ✅ Auto-save their work (never lose progress)
- ✅ See real-time word/character counts
- ✅ Get validation feedback before submitting
- ✅ Fair daily limit enforcement (1 per day across all courses)
- ✅ Full authentication flow with Firebase

---
