---

## 🎯 Objective Completed

Successfully optimized AP Psychology FRQ grading prompts to reduce token usage by **~40%** while maintaining strict grading standards and accuracy.

---

## 📦 Changes Deployed

### 1. AP Psychology AAQ (Article Analysis Question)
**File:** `src/pages/APPsychPracticeExamAAQSelect.tsx`

**Prompt Optimization:**
- **Before:** ~800 tokens (verbose, full sentences, extensive formatting)
- **After:** ~480 tokens (compact, abbreviated, efficient)
- **Reduction:** 320 tokens saved per request (~40%)

**Set 1 (2025) Prompt:**
```
STRICT AP Psych grader. Award 1 pt ONLY if 100% correct with exact terminology. 
Vague/partial/generic = 0 pts. Random words = 0 pts.

Study: 127 students watched mock crime video, then read summary with misinformation 
(Low=20%, Med=50%, High=80% misleading sentences). Answered 40 MC questions. 
Results: High group 63% correct, Low 74%. Trust in summary affected resistance.

A. Method: Must say "experiment/experimental" (not study/observation)
B. Operational def: "80% misleading sentences" (not "lots")
C. Mean: High (63%) LOWER than Low (74%), shows misinformation reduced accuracy
D. Ethics: Name specific guideline (informed consent/debriefing/deception) + how applied
E. Generalizability: Discuss college students, lab setting, mock video (not vague "small sample")
F. Misinformation effect: Use Loftus + specific data (63% vs 74%)

Total /6. Be harsh.
```

**Set 2 (20252) Prompt:**
```
STRICT AP Psych grader. Award 1 pt ONLY if 100% correct with exact terminology. 
Vague/partial/generic = 0 pts. Random words = 0 pts.

Study: 16 dog-owner pairs. 4 trials (owner cry, stranger cry, owner laugh, stranger laugh). 
Within-subjects, counterbalanced. Person-oriented behaviors = looking/touching/approaching/
vocalizing at person. Results: Cry trials (42-46 behaviors) >> laugh (15-20). p<0.001. 
Dogs respond to emotion, not familiarity.

A. Method: "Experiment/experimental, within-subjects" (not observation)
B. Operational def: List all 4 behaviors (not vague "reactions")
C. TRICK: No "talking" trials exist. If answered = made up = 0 pts. Must catch error or discuss cry vs laugh
D. Ethics: Animal welfare/no harm/owner consent + how applied
E. Generalizability: 16 dogs, lab setting, breed limits (not vague "small")
F. Stimulus discrimination: Dogs differentiate cry/laugh OR explain NOT operant conditioning (no reinforcement, innate cues)

Total /6. Be harsh.
```

### 2. AP Psychology EBQ (Evidence-Based Question)
**File:** `src/pages/APPsychPracticeExamEBQSelect.tsx`

**Prompt Optimization:**
- **Before:** ~800 tokens (verbose structure similar to AAQ)
- **After:** ~480 tokens (compact, matching AAQ optimization)
- **Reduction:** 320 tokens saved per request (~40%)

**Both Sets (1 & 2) Prompt:**
```
Strict AP Psych grader. Question 2 EBQ, 2025. Rubric: A (1pt): specific, defensible 
claim in psych; B(i) (1pt): evidence from 1 source; B(ii) (1pt): explanation via psych 
concept; C(i) (1pt): evidence from different source; C(ii) (1pt): explanation via different 
concept. Award point only if correct, clear, uses psych terms. No credit for vague/inaccurate. 
Check correct source cited. Brief explanation per point, total /5. No feedback.

Sources: 1-Markus'78: 45 men dressing (lab coat/socks/shoes) alone/watched/incidental. 
Well-learned faster w/ audience; new slower. Shows social facilitation/impairment. 
2-Huguet'14: 11 baboons touchscreen. Conflict trials slower w/ high-rank males present. 
Social interference under pressure/hierarchy. 3-Claypoole'19: 132 students vigilance 
(numbers, 24min). Evaluative observers → more targets detected. No diff alone vs 
non-evaluative. Social evaluation improves vigilance.

Prompt: A-Claim re "Does presence improve performance?" B(i)-Evidence 1 source, 
B(ii)-Explanation w/ psych theory. C(i)-Evidence different source, C(ii)-Explanation 
w/ different theory.
```
