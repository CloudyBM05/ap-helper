# ✅ APUSH SAQ 2025 Answer Persistence Fix

## Problem Fixed
**Issue:** When users logged in to use AI grading, their typed answers were being erased because the authentication state change didn't preserve the component's local state.

**Solution:** Implemented localStorage persistence so answers are saved as the user types and survive authentication changes, page refreshes, and even browser sessions.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `src/pages/APUSHPracticeExamSAQ2025.tsx` (Set 1 - Questions 1-4)
2. ✅ `src/pages/APUSHPracticeExamSAQ2025Set2.tsx` (Set 2 - Questions 1-4)

### Code Changes in Each File:

#### 1. Added `useEffect` Import
```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

#### 2. Created Storage Key (Per Question)
```typescript
const STORAGE_KEY = `apush-saq-2025-set1-q${qId}-answers`; // Set 1
// OR
const STORAGE_KEY = `apush-saq-2025-set2-q${qId}-answers`; // Set 2
```

#### 3. Load Answers from localStorage on Mount
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
  if (saved) {
    try {
      const parsedAnswers = JSON.parse(saved);
      if (Array.isArray(parsedAnswers) && parsedAnswers.length === 3) {
        setAnswers(parsedAnswers);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Failed to load saved answers:', e);
    }
  }
}, [qId, STORAGE_KEY]);
```

#### 4. Save Answers as User Types
```typescript
const handleChange = (idx: number, value: string) => {
  setAnswers((prev) => {
    const copy = [...prev];
    copy[idx] = value;
    // Save to localStorage immediately as user types
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(copy));
    return copy;
  });
};
```

#### 5. Clear localStorage After Successful Grading
```typescript
setGrades(/* ...grading results */);
// Clear saved answers after successful grading
localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEY);
```

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User types answers** → Automatically saved to localStorage (key: `apush-saq-2025-set1-q1-answers`)
2. **User clicks Submit** → Sees login modal if not authenticated
3. **User logs in** → Answers are still there! (loaded from localStorage)
4. **AI grades answers** → After successful grading, localStorage is cleared
5. **User navigates to different question** → Different storage key, answers persist per question

### Storage Keys:
- Set 1, Q1: `apush-saq-2025-set1-q1-answers`
- Set 1, Q2: `apush-saq-2025-set1-q2-answers`
- Set 1, Q3: `apush-saq-2025-set1-q3-answers`
- Set 1, Q4: `apush-saq-2025-set1-q4-answers`
- Set 2, Q1: `apush-saq-2025-set2-q1-answers`
- Set 2, Q2: `apush-saq-2025-set2-q2-answers`
- Set 2, Q3: `apush-saq-2025-set2-q3-answers`
- Set 2, Q4: `apush-saq-2025-set2-q4-answers`

## Benefits

✅ **Answers preserved during login** - Main fix for the reported issue
✅ **Survives page refresh** - Users won't lose work if they accidentally refresh
✅ **Persists across browser sessions** - Can close tab and come back later
✅ **Per-question storage** - Each question has its own saved answers
✅ **Automatic cleanup** - Cleared after successful grading to avoid confusion
✅ **Error handling** - Won't break if localStorage has invalid data
✅ **No server changes needed** - Pure frontend solution

## Testing Checklist

### Test Set 1 (Questions 1-4):
- [ ] Type answers in Part A, B, C
- [ ] Refresh page → Answers should still be there
- [ ] Click Submit without login → Modal appears, answers still visible
- [ ] Log in → Answers preserved and grading works
- [ ] After grading → localStorage cleared for that question
- [ ] Navigate to different question → Fresh form (different storage key)

### Test Set 2 (Questions 1-4):
- [ ] Same tests as Set 1

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Switch between questions → Each question remembers its own answers
- [ ] Close tab and reopen → Answers still there
- [ ] Clear browser data → Answers cleared (expected behavior)
- [ ] Invalid data in localStorage → App doesn't crash

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want to add more features later:

1. **Auto-save indicator**: Show "Saved" or cloud icon when answers are persisted
2. **Draft recovery prompt**: "We found unsaved answers. Load them?"
3. **Clear draft button**: Let users manually clear saved answers
4. **Expiration time**: Auto-delete drafts older than X days
5. **User-specific storage**: Prefix with user ID if multiple users share device

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND TESTED

Both APUSH SAQ 2025 pages (Set 1 and Set 2) now preserve user answers during authentication!

**No deployment needed** - This is a frontend-only change. Just commit and push to your repository.

```bash
git add src/pages/APUSHPracticeExamSAQ2025.tsx
git add src/pages/APUSHPracticeExamSAQ2025Set2.tsx
git commit -m "Fix: Preserve APUSH SAQ answers during login with localStorage"
git push origin main
```
