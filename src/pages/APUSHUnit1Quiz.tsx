		stimulus: 'Description of Native American Societies before European Contact',
		text: '“Native American groups across the continent adapted to their environments in diverse ways. For example, the Iroquois in the Northeast lived in settled villages and practiced agriculture, growing the ‘Three Sisters’ crops: corn, beans, and squash. In contrast, the Great Plains tribes were often nomadic, following buffalo herds and living in portable homes such as tipis.

		stimulus: "Excerpt from Hernán Cortés's Second Letter to Charles V (1520)",

				options: [
					'A) That Native peoples lacked organized government',
					'B) That Native people had no religion',
					'c) That the Americas had no valuable resources',
					'D) That Native Americans had not settled in one place'

	{
		id: 4,
		stimulus: 'Excerpt on Differences in Worldviews Between Native Americans and Europeans',
		text: "“Native American groups generally viewed land as a communal resource, to be used and cared for by the community as a whole rather than owned by individuals. Their spiritual beliefs emphasized harmony with nature and the presence of spirits in animals, plants, and natural features. In contrast, European colonists believed in private property rights and viewed land primarily as a commodity to be bought, sold, and exploited. Europeans also practiced a monotheistic religion centered on Christianity, which shaped their worldview and interactions with indigenous peoples.”",
		questions: [
			{
				question: "Which of the following best describes a major source of conflict between Native Americans and Europeans based on the passage?",
				options: [

				options: [
					'A) Were identical to European Christian beliefs',
					'B) Encouraged exploitation of natural resources',
					'C) Promoted a harmonious relationship with the environment',

				],
				answer: 2,
				explanation: "The passage explicitly states that Native American spiritual beliefs emphasized harmony with nature, showing their belief in a balanced relationship with the environment."
