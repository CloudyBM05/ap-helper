# AP Biology Long FRQ Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully updated AP Biology Long FRQ frontend to match Short FRQ standards with full authentication, daily usage limits, and robust word/character count validation.

## Implementation Date
October 9, 2025

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- **`src/pages/APBiologyLongFRQ.tsx`** - Updated with full feature set
- **`src/pages/APBiologyLongFRQ_BACKUP.tsx`** - Backup of original file

### Backend
- **`grader_api.py`** - Already contains `/api/grade-apbio-frq` endpoint (created in previous update)

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication
- ✅ Integrated `useAuth` hook from `../hooks/useAuth`
- ✅ Added `AuthModal` component for sign-in prompts
- ✅ Blocks grading if user is not authenticated
- ✅ Displays authentication modal on unauthorized access
- ✅ Includes Firebase UID in API request headers (`Authorization: Bearer {uid}`)

### 2. Daily Usage Limits
- ✅ Backend enforces 1 grading per day across ALL AP courses
- ✅ Returns HTTP 429 status when daily limit is reached
- ✅ Frontend displays user-friendly error message for daily limits
- ✅ Clear messaging: "Daily limit reached. You can grade one AP exam per day."

### 3. Word/Character Count Validation
- ✅ **Minimum Words**: 20 words per part
- ✅ **Maximum Words**: 150 words per part
- ✅ **Maximum Characters**: 1000 characters per part
- ✅ Real-time word/character counter below each textarea
- ✅ Color-coded indicators:
  - Green: Within acceptable range (20-150 words)
  - Red: Below minimum, above maximum words, or exceeds character limit
- ✅ Validation before submission with clear error messages
- ✅ Blocks submission if any part fails validation

### 4. User Experience Enhancements
- ✅ Auto-save answers to localStorage (per FRQ set)
- ✅ Auto-load saved answers on page mount
- ✅ Clear saved answers after successful grading
- ✅ Disabled inputs during grading process
- ✅ Loading state: "Grading..." button text
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for all API responses

### 5. API Integration
- ✅ Uses `/api/grade-apbio-frq` endpoint
- ✅ Adaptive model selection based on FRQ length:
  - ≤4 parts: `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` (cost-effective)
  - >4 parts: `gpt-4o-mini` (better quality)
- ✅ Proper request format matching backend expectations
- ✅ Handles all error scenarios:
  - 401: Authentication required
  - 429: Daily limit reached
  - 500/other: Generic AI service error

## Validation Rules

### Per-Part Requirements
```typescript
MIN_WORDS = 20
MAX_WORDS = 150
MAX_CHARS = 1000
```

### Validation Logic
1. Empty answers are rejected
2. Word count must be between 20-150
3. Character count must not exceed 1000
4. All parts must pass validation before submission

## localStorage Keys
- Set 1: `apbio-long-frq-set1-answers`
- Set 2: `apbio-long-frq-set2-answers`

## Error Messages

### Validation Errors
- Empty: `"Part {X} cannot be empty."`
- Too few words: `"Part {X} must be at least 20 words. Current: {N} words."`
- Too many words: `"Part {X} must be no more than 150 words. Current: {N} words."`
- Too many chars: `"Part {X} must be no more than 1000 characters. Current: {N} characters."`

### API Errors
- 401: `"Authentication required. Please sign in to continue."`
- 429: `"Daily limit reached. You can grade one AP exam per day."` (or custom error from backend)
- Other: `"Failed to contact AI grading service. Please try again."`

## Backend Endpoint Details

### Route
`POST /api/grade-apbio-frq`

### Decorators
- `@require_auth` - Validates Firebase UID from Authorization header
- `@track_usage('apbio-frq')` - Enforces daily limit across all AP courses

### Model Selection Logic
```python
num_parts = len(answers)
if num_parts <= 4:
    model_to_use = 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125'  # Faster, cheaper for short FRQs
else:
    model_to_use = 'gpt-4o-mini'  # Better quality for complex FRQs
```

### Request Format
```json
{
  "answers": ["answer1", "answer2", ...],
  "prompt_intro": "AI grading prompt",
  "sources": "",
  "questions": ""
}
```

### Response Format (Success)
```json
{
  "result": ["Grade for Part A", "Grade for Part B", ...]
}
```

### Response Format (Error)
```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Open Long FRQ Set 1
- [ ] Verify PDF loads correctly
- [ ] Test word/character counters update in real-time
- [ ] Test validation with <20 words (should show red)
- [ ] Test validation with >150 words (should show red)
- [ ] Test validation with >1000 characters (should show red)
- [ ] Test submission without authentication (should show auth modal)
- [ ] Test submission with valid answers (should succeed)
- [ ] Test daily limit (second submission should fail with 429)
- [ ] Verify answers auto-save and auto-load
- [ ] Verify answers clear after successful grading

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test with authentication
curl -X POST https://ap-helper-2d9f117e9bdb.herokuapp.com/api/grade-apbio-frq \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {FIREBASE_UID}" \
  -d '{
    "answers": ["Answer 1", "Answer 2", "Answer 3"],
    "prompt_intro": "Test prompt",
    "sources": "",
    "questions": ""
  }'

# Test daily limit (run twice)
# Second request should return 429
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete AP Biology Long FRQ with auth, limits, validation"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Backend Deployment
```bash
# Backend is already deployed with /api/grade-apbio-frq endpoint
# No additional deployment needed
```

### 3. Verification

- Navigate to AP Biology → Long FRQ
- Test all features end-to-end

## Comparison with Short FRQ

### Similarities
- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ Daily usage limits enforced
- ✅ Auto-save/auto-load functionality
- ✅ Real-time word/character counters
- ✅ Same validation patterns
- ✅ Same error handling
- ✅ Same API endpoint

### Differences
- **Word limits**: Long FRQ (20-150) vs Short FRQ (15-100)
- **Character limit**: Long FRQ (1000) vs Short FRQ (700)
- **Parts per FRQ**: Long FRQ has more parts (6-9 vs 4)

## Model Cost Analysis

### Set 1 (9 parts) - Uses gpt-4o-mini
- Parts: A, B(i), B(ii), B(iii), C(i), C(ii), C(iii), D(i), D(ii)
- Estimated cost: $0.03-0.05 per grading

### Set 2 (6 parts) - Uses gpt-4o-mini
- Parts: A, B(ii), C(i), C(ii), D(i), D(ii)
- Estimated cost: $0.02-0.04 per grading

## Success Metrics
