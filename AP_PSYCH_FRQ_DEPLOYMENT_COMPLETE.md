- ✅ Enhanced error handling with clear messages
- ✅ Auto-clear localStorage on success
- ✅ Updated endpoint: `/api/grade-psych-frq`
- ✅ Uses gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 (cost-effective for concise responses)

### 2. APPsychPracticeExamEBQSelect.tsx (Evidence-Based Question)
- ✅ Authentication with useAuth hook
- ✅ AuthModal integration
- ✅ localStorage persistence (auto-save)
- ✅ Word count: 15-150 per part (3 parts: A, B, C with subparts)
- ✅ Character count: max 1000 per part
- ✅ Real-time count display with color-coded warnings
- ✅ Daily limit: 1 per day across ALL AP Psych FRQ types (shared with AAQ)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling
- ✅ Auto-clear localStorage on success
- ✅ Updated endpoint: `/api/grade-psych-frq`
- ✅ Uses gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 (cost-effective for detailed but structured responses)

## Backend Integration ✅

### Endpoint: `/api/grade-psych-frq`
- **Backend URL:** `https://ap-helper-2d9f117e9bdb.herokuapp.com`
- **Model:** gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 (cost-effective choice for Psychology FRQs)
- **Authentication:** Bearer token from useAuth
- **Daily Limits:** 1 grading per day across ALL AP Psychology FRQ types (AAQ + EBQ)
- **Response Format:** Array of {score, explanation} objects with total

### Why gpt-3.5-turbo-0125?
- AP Psychology FRQs are shorter and more structured than APUSH/AP World essays
- AAQ: 6 parts with concise answers (10-100 words each)
- EBQ: 3 parts with evidence + explanation (15-150 words each)
- Responses are more formulaic (identify, explain, apply concepts)
- Cost savings: ~90% cheaper than GPT-4 models
- Quality: Sufficient for grading structured, concept-based responses

## Word Count Limits by FRQ Type

| FRQ Type | Min Words/Part | Max Words/Part | Max Characters/Part | Total Parts |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| AAQ (Article Analysis) | 10 | 100 | 700 | 6 (A-F) |
| EBQ (Evidence-Based) | 15 | 150 | 1000 | 3 (A, B, C with subparts) |

**Rationale:**
- AAQ: Shorter, focused responses identifying concepts and applying them
- EBQ: Longer responses requiring evidence from sources + psychological explanations
- Both are significantly shorter than APUSH/AP World DBQ/LEQ essays
- Limits encourage concise, on-point answers (as per AP rubrics)

## localStorage Keys

- AAQ: `appsych-aaq-set{setId}-answers`
- EBQ: `appsych-ebq-set{setId}-answers`
- Daily usage: `appsych-frq-last-graded` (shared across all AP Psych FRQ types)

## Daily Usage Limit - SHARED ACROSS ALL FRQ TYPES ✅

**Key Feature:** Students can only grade **1 AP Psychology FRQ per day** total, regardless of type.

**Implementation:**
- Single localStorage key: `appsych-frq-last-graded`
- Tracks date of last grading (any FRQ type)
- Both AAQ and EBQ check this same key
- Error message clearly states limit applies across all FRQ types

**Example:**
- Student grades AAQ Set 1 on Monday → Limit reached for Monday
- Student tries to grade EBQ Set 1 on same day → Blocked with error message
- Student can grade again on Tuesday (any FRQ type)

This is **different from APUSH/AP World/AP Gov** where:
- APUSH: 1 SAQ per day, 1 DBQ per day, 1 LEQ per day (separate limits per type)
- AP World: Same as APUSH (separate limits)
- AP Gov: 1 FRQ per day (shared across all AP Gov FRQ types)
- **AP Psych: 1 FRQ per day (shared across AAQ + EBQ)**

## Key Differences from Other AP Courses

### 1. Daily Limit Structure
- **APUSH/AP World:** Separate limits per FRQ type (1 SAQ + 1 DBQ + 1 LEQ per day = 3 total)
- **AP Gov:** Shared limit across all FRQ types (1 per day total)
- **AP Psych:** Shared limit across AAQ + EBQ (1 per day total) ← Matches AP Gov pattern

### 2. Word Count Limits
- **APUSH/AP World:** Higher limits (100-300 words for SAQ, 300+ for DBQ/LEQ)
- **AP Gov:** Moderate limits (10-150 words per part)
- **AP Psych:** Similar to AP Gov (10-150 words per part) ← Shorter, more concise

### 3. Backend Model Selection
- **APUSH/AP World:** gpt-4o-mini or GPT-4 (longer, complex essays)
- **AP Gov:** gpt-4o-mini (moderate complexity)
- **AP Psych:** gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 (shorter, structured responses) ← Most cost-effective

### 4. FRQ Structure
- **APUSH/AP World:** Document-based analysis, contextualization, synthesis
- **AP Gov:** Application of political concepts
- **AP Psych AAQ:** Identify research methods, operational definitions, ethical guidelines
- **AP Psych EBQ:** Claim + Evidence from sources + Psychological concepts

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If localStorage not working:
1. Check browser privacy settings
2. Clear cache and hard reload
3. Verify localStorage is enabled
4. Check browser console for errors

### If daily limit not enforced correctly:
1. Check localStorage key: `appsych-frq-last-graded`
2. Verify date format (ISO string split on 'T')
3. Test across AAQ and EBQ (should share limit)
4. Clear localStorage to reset for testing

### If grading fails:
1. Check network tab for errors
2. Verify backend is running (Heroku)
3. Check authentication token
4. Verify endpoint: `/api/grade-psych-frq`
5. Check backend logs for model errors

### If word count seems wrong:
1. Count uses `/\s+/` regex for whitespace
2. Trim removes leading/trailing spaces
3. Empty strings return 0
4. Multiple spaces count as one delimiter

### If authentication doesn't work:
1. Check useAuth hook is imported
2. Verify AuthModal is rendered
3. Check getAuthHeaders() returns valid token
4. Test login/signup flow
5. Clear auth state and re-login

## Future Enhancements

### Optional Features to Consider:
- Add more AAQ/EBQ sets (sets 3, 4, etc.)
- Progress tracking across all AP Psych FRQs
- Grading history with score trends
- Export results as PDF
- Timed practice mode
- Flashcards for psychological concepts
- Study guide with key terms
- Practice quizzes

### Performance Optimizations:
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Lazy loading for route-based components
- Manual chunking for vendor libraries
- Reduce bundle size below 500 kB warning threshold

### Model Upgrades (if quality issues arise):
- Test gpt-4o-mini if gpt-3.5-turbo struggles
- A/B test grading quality
- Monitor student feedback
- Compare against official AP rubrics
