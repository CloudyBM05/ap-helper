## 🔄 Daily Limit Logic

The daily limit system works as follows:

1. **Shared Limit Across All AP Courses:**
   - User gets **1 grading per day total**
   - Applies to: SAQ, DBQ, LEQ, Essay, AP Gov, AP Psych, AP Micro, AP Macro, **AP Human Geography**
   - Once you grade ANY FRQ, you cannot grade another until tomorrow

2. **Usage Tracking:**
   - Stored in `daily_usage.json` on Heroku
   - Tracks: user email, date, count, last endpoint type
   - Resets automatically at midnight UTC

3. **Error Messages:**
   - Shows which type was already used
   - Clear "Try again tomorrow" message
   - Consistent across all endpoints
